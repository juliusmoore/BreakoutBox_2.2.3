BreakoutBox is a tile based game.

Instructions are for Windows.

Java is required to run this game. To see if Java is installed and available from the command line, start PowerShell and type "java". If Java is unavailable, either the java bin directory must be added to Windows' Path environment variable or Java must be installed.

Start the game by doubleclicking BreakoutBox.bat or by typing "java BreakoutBox" from the command line.

When the game starts it will list the available maps, and ask the player to choose which map to load by typing in the map's name and pressing enter. Be sure the window is selected and use the arrow keys to move. Alternately, the command line may be used to move the player. Collect the candy and move to the exit without falling off a cliff.
