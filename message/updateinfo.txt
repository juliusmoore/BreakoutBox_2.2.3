2.2.3
-Added Handle, which will make it not nessesary to pass as many objects around. However I will restrict its use.
-Currently Handle has two functions which can be reference to two outputs and pass text onto those outputs.
-Finetuned output to make it more versatile (Output now 1.1).
2.2.2
-Fixed a bug in EntityTracker which caused it to only be able to handle one entity (now 1.1)
-Changed the BounceEntity so that it will be easier to modify when parameters are added to entities (Now 1.3)
-Created a new class which will be used for dialogue/error output (Output 1.0 created)
2.2.1
-Successfully integrated the signalling system with EntityTracker and created a new Entity, BounceEntity
-Reworked the method used to load the map from a task based approach to a signal based approach
	Map is now 2.1
2.2.0
-Created a new method for handling entities inluding the player, EntityTracker 1.0 can handle 1000 entities
-Tweaked Player and Entity so that tile checking always happens with movement. They are both now 1.1
-Player and Entity have also been modified to work with the new Entity Tracker.
-Changed the update and gameplay speed from 500ms to 17ms
-Changed initialization so that any map I've created can be selected without recompliling.
-Map Generator Updated to be able to handle the new EntityTracker. Is now 2.0
-Note that handling the new bmaper 2.0 has some serious issues; does not work
2.1.2
-Added rudimentary keyboard input. Discovered that entities might need a move command that combines logic.
-Fixed bugs with trying to reder the edges of the map. In doing so, discovered a mistake in the
	map handler (Map, formerly MapGen) where it would store too high a value in widtha thereby preventing easy
	handling of the left side of maps in future code. Caused a lot of problems before discovery :) Map is now 1.3
	World is now 3.0.1
2.1.1
-Menu only half shows...
-DrawLoop is forcing the Menu to render for debugging...
2.1.0
-Added background rendering to World
-Added player rendering to World
-Made candy no longer reusable by changing map values
2.0.3
-Multiple changes and tweaks in order to get GUI functional and stable; now is ready to be integrated.
The largest change was changing the core output of Firestarter from a Canvas to a JPanel. Trouble is
now I'm not sure how to use Graphics2D for hardware acceleration instead of just Graphics.
2.0.1
-Prepared for merging with Firestarter 2.1.0 by creating Entity, and Player. Player handles the player's position
and implements map interpretation logic. Goal is to be able to use graphics, and have non player entities running
threads different from the one the player uses to interact.
1.2
-Fixed an oversight in MapGen: Detecting how much candy there is. (now is the next version)
-Made information generated by the commands easier to pass to a new output system; ie: graphical.
-Fixed a bug in Storyteller which caused it to not be able to display a file twice. (now is the next version)
1.1
-Primary Addition: MapGen, a map generator with code that should be simple enough to expand for more kinds of tiles.
Note: This file was added but not linked up to the commands in this version.
